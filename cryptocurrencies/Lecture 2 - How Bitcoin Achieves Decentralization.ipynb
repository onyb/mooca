    "Key technical challenge of decentralized e-cash: **distributed consensus**\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional motivation: reliability in distributed systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed key-value store enables various applications: DNS, public key directory, stock trades, etc. These are good targets for Altcoins!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining distributed consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "- The protocol terminates and all correct nodes decide on the same value.\n",
    "- This value must have been proposed by some correct node.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system\n",
    "\n",
    "- When Alice wants to pay Bob, she **broadcasts the transaction** to all Bitcoin nodes.\n",
    "- Bob's computer is not in the picture.\n",
    "- Bob could run a node to listen on the transactions being broadcast, but his listening is not necessary for him to recieve the funds.\n",

    "\n",
    "At any given time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All nodes have a sequence of **blocks of transactions** they've reached consensus on\n",
    "- Each node has a set of outstanding transactions it's heard about\n",

    "\n",
    "- Nodes may crash\n",
    "- Nodes may be malicious\n",
    "- Network is imperfect\n",
    "  * Not all pairs of nodes connected\n",

    "Example: Paxos\n",
    "- Never produces inconsistent result, but can (rarely) get stuck.\n",

    "#### Understanding impossibility results\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "3. In each round a **random** node gets to broadcast its block\n",

    "\n",
    "- Protection against invalid transactions is cryptographic, but enforeced by consensus.\n",
    "- Protection against double-spending is purely by consensus\n",
    "- You're never 100% sure a transaction is in consensus branch. Guarantee is probailistic."
