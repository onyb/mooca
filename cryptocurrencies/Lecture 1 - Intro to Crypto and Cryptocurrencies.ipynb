    "### Hash property 1: Collision-free\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nobody can **find** `x` and `y` such that `x != y and H(x) = H(y)`.\n",
    "- Collisions do exist because the sample space of `x` and `y` is infinite, whereas `H(x)` and `H(y)` is limited to a a fixed set of bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to find a colliison\n",
    "  * Try $2^{130}$ randomly chosen inputs\n",
    "  * `99.8%` chance that two of them will collide\n",
    "  * This method works no matter what the `H` is\n",
    "  * ... but it takes too long to matter\n",
    "  * $2^{130}$ is an astronomical number\n",
    "- Is there a faster way to find collisions?\n",
    "  * For some possible `H`'s, yes\n",
    "  * For others, we don't know of one\n",
    "- No `H` has been proven to be collision-free\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application: Hash as message digest\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we know `H(x) = H(y)`, it's safe to assume that `x = y`.\n",
    "- To recognize a file that we saw before, just remember its hash.\n",
    "- Useful because the hash is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash property 2: Hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given `H(x)`, it is infeasible to find `x`.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  * Flip a coin, and return `H('heads')` or `H('tails')` depending upon the outcome of the flip.\n",
    "  * It is easy to find `x` in this scenario!\n",
    "  * The reason why an adversary can guess the value of `x` is that there are only a couple of possible values for `x`.\n",
    "- **Hiding property:** If `r` is chosen from a probability distribution that has *high min-entropy*, then given `H(r | x)`, it is infeasible to find `x`.\n",
    "- High min-entropy means that the distribution is \"very spead out\", so that no particular value is chosen with more than negligible probability.\n",
    "\n",

    "commit(msg) := H(key | msg), H(key)\n",
    "verify(com, key, msg) := H(key | msg) == com\n",
    "```\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Hash property 3:  Puzzle-friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "For every possible output value `y`, if `k` is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is infeasible to find `x` such that `H(k | x) = y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application: Search puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a \"puzzle ID\" `id` (from a high min-entropy distribution), and a target set `Y`, try to find a \"solution\" `x` such that\n",

    "H(id | x) in Y\n",
    "```\n",
